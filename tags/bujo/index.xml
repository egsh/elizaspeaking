      <description>My shiny little notebook has finally run out of pages. It will always hold a special place in my heart as being my very first bullet journal. As I mentioned in my First Time Bullet Journaller in Distress blog post, it was a little &amp;lsquo;Aloha&amp;rsquo; design, midi-sized, lined Paperblanks notebook which perfectly supported me with trialling the whole bullet journal thing.
Entering into the world of bullet journaling has helped me to realise many things about myself and others, as well as keeping me on track with tasks and accomplishing goals.</description>

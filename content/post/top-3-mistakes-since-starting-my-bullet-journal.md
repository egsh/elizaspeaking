This reflection prompted me to share with aspiring bullet journallers some of the mistakes that I made and that they potentially face when getting sucked into the Pinterest jungle of awesomeness that is bullet journal spreads, doodles and stationary!

Top 3 Mistakes Since Starting My Bullet Journal

1. Not sticking with the KISS principle

It is easy to become overwhelmed and excited by all the bullet journal inspiration that the internet has on offer. I draw a lot of my layout inspiration from Pinterest and Instagram which are filled with awe-inspiring layouts, spreads, lists, doodles, tracker ideas that are obviously created by naturally talented people who have a bunch of time on their hands. As I found out, it's actually deceiving just how time consuming it is to create elaborate spreads on a regular basis.

After trial and error in my own journal with dailies, weeklies, monthlies, colours, illustrations, lettering, trying to cram every task I can think of into one day etc, I realised that I had been carried away from keeping it simple stupid (KISS). I had to re-evaluate my time management and what I actually needed to achieve in a day and dial back my spread creations and my task lists. Now, wise Eliza doesn't plan anymore than three tasks per day and feels accomplished when they are achieved.

1. Losing sight of my goals

Setting goals is a really great thing to do, so long as you're committed and enthusiastic. There is so much inspiration on the internet for goals to track and layouts to track them on. At the start of the year, I took inspiration from the internet and set myself a number of goals like losing weight and reading books, only one of which I am currently on track for (starting this blog!). The notion of goal setting was really appealing to me because I hadn't set any for such a long time.

The mistake I made was not in choosing something to do but in setting the goal itself. One of my chosen goals was to finish reading four books in this year. While reading is wonderful, I lost sight of my reading goal by not taking into account all the readings I would be doing for university. I now realise that finishing four non-uni-related books is very ambitious for the not-so-keen reader that I am.

1. Not utilising the original bullet journal system and to get overwhelmed by what everyone else says you should do
1.

I encourage aspiring bullet journallers to deeply consider what it that they want from their bullet journal. Is it total functionality that you seek? Is it functionality with a hint of creative flare? Or is it a place to plan out your life amidst a creative arts book? There are horses for courses and you just need to consider what it is that you need for yourself and not feel pressured by the glamour that the internet puts forward to not have the most beautiful journal the world has ever seen.

Although I called them mistakes, perhaps I should put them down to learning curbs because I am at peace with what I've done but know that I need to alter it going forward.

In my next post, I'll show you how I'm starting to tone back layouts to be simpler to establish and update but still with that hint of creative flare.

Setting yourself up for failure by being overzealous with your expectations is unkind and unwise.

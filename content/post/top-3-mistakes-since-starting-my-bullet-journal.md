Great things can't be rushed, some wise people once said. So here's to my second ever blog post! Hopefully I've started my blog train chugging and it can gain some momentum from here. I've not only neglected my blog, but also my bullet journal of late because I got a bit overwhelmed with uni exams and other stuff going on.

I adore my little notebook because it has become my first 'bullet journal'. It's a cute little Paper Blanks notebook that Simon bought for me. I'd like to think that he knows me super well (and that it wasn't a fluke) because the design is colourful, has flowers AND it's shiny!

I've been bullet journalling for 7 months to the day and, boy, have I made some mistakes! I'm not talking about spelling errors or drawing a line out of place. I'm talking about mistakes with how I physically and practically use my bullet journal. The past 7 months have actually been a labour of love over my journal. Laborious as I tried to create colourful, complex yet practical designs throughout, as you can see below.

But the love was there because I was enjoying the time I put into being creative on something that was purely mine. It all began to fall out of perspective when I was getting behind in the weekly spreads (how can you plan for the future if you haven't a spread to plan it in?!) and the time I was sinking into the layouts was time I'd be taking from other priority tasks (like uni work!)

I pretty much gave it a break through June and just did the bare minimum to keep the year tracking on. I took stock of what I was doing, how it was moving forward, and what I actually wanted to get out of my bullet journal. I realised that my bullet journal had become a labour of love; a bit of a chore; a burden to keep updated. None of these things are what I actually wanted from journal. I've decided that it should be a companion that is functional at keeping my life organised, simple to keep updated and has a hint of creative flare.

This reflection prompted me to share with aspiring bullet journallers some of the mistakes that I made and that they potentially face when getting sucked into the Pinterest jungle of awesomeness that is bullet journal spreads, doodles and stationary!

Top 3 Mistakes Since Starting My Bullet Journal

1. Losing sight of the KISS principle

Admittedly, I am addicted to Pinterest and that is where I draw a lot of my layout inspiration from. It is filled with awe-inspiring layout, spread, list, doodle, tracker ideas that are obviously done by people with natural talent and a bunch of time on their hands. It's actually deceiving just how time consuming it is to create elaborate spreads on a regular basis.

The people who habitually create daily spreads are especially impressive because I'm thinking "I can only just get myself out the door on time with everything I need for the day, let alone having also set up a daily tasks spread!" I tried dailies, in addition to weeklies and monthlies, and sunk very fast. I found that I simply didn't need to plan out my day, task by task, on a daily basis. My main tasks were already listed in my weekly spread and having all that space on my page encouraged me to fill it with 'other stuff' that I realistically would never have time to achieve. I would get into a funk by looking at the growing number of tasks from not having achieved the huge list of tasks I had set myself for the day and keep moving them to the next day and the next, until I would eventually just cross them off and then feel guilt when looking back at how many times I merged the tasks. I don't let that happen anymore though. Wise Eliza doesn't plan any more than 3 tasks per day because the day disappears beyond that.

1. Losing sight of my goals

1. Losing sight of the original bullet journaling system and to get overwhelmed by what everyone else says you should do

I encourage aspiring bullet journallers to deeply consider what it that they want from their bullet journal. Is it total functionality that you seek? Is it functionality with a hint of creative flare? Or is it a place to plan out your life amidst a creative arts book? There are horses for courses and you just need to consider what it is that you need for yourself and not feel pressured by the glamour that the internet puts forward to not have the most beautiful journal the world has ever seen.

In my next post, I'll show you how I'm starting to tone back layouts to be simpler to establish and update but still with that hint of creative flare.

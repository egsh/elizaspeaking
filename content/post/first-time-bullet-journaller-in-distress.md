Great things can't be rushed, some wise people once said. So here's to my second ever blog post! Hopefully I've started my blog train chugging and it can gain some momentum from here. I've not only neglected my blog, but also my bullet journal of late because I got a bit overwhelmed with uni exams and other stuff going on.

I adore my little notebook because it has become my first 'bullet journal'. You may have seen my bullet journal featured in my previous post or on my Instagram.  I'll do a blog post at some point in the near future about what exactly a bullet journal is and how it could change your life. Anyway, mine is a cute little Paper Blanks notebook that Simon bought for me. I'd like to think that he actually knows me well enough to have picked it on purpose (and that it wasn't a fluke) because the design is colourful, has flowers AND it's shiny!

I've been bullet journalling for 7 months to the day and, boy, have I made some mistakes! I'm not talking about spelling errors or drawing a line out of place. I'm talking about mistakes with how I physically and practically use my bullet journal. The rollercoaster that was starting a bullet journal had left me as a 'first time bullet journaller in distress.' So I slowed my journalling right down and pretty much gave it a break through July; only doing the bare minimum to keep the year tracking on.

Through July, I took stock of what I was doing, how it was moving forward, and what I actually wanted to get out of my bullet journal. I realised that it had become a labour of love; a bit of a chore; a burden to keep updated. It became laborious as I tried to create colourful and complex yet practical designs throughout. But the love was there because I was enjoying the time I put into being creative on something that was purely mine. The picture below is surely creative and colourful but it's crazy busy and took me ages to establish. Just one example of what I was getting myself into without realising the time that I would lose through the creating and updating of it all.

It all began to fall out of perspective when I was getting behind in the weekly spreads (how can you plan for the future if you haven't a spread to plan it in?!) and the time I was sinking into the layouts was time I'd be taking from other priority tasks (like uni work!).

None of this is what I actually wanted from my journal. Now that I have a clearer perspective of how I wish to continue my bullet journal, I realise that it should be a companion that is functional at keeping my life organised and simple to update, with a hint of creative flare. This is precisely where I intend to start off again in August.

Intrigued to start your own bullet journal? In my next blog post, I share the top 3 mistakes that I've made since starting my bullet journal. It's possibly a useful starting point for anyone considering bullet journalling. It may help you to gain some perspective of how to be practical and not get overwhelmed and sucked into the glamorous spreads and layouts on Pinterest. I've made some tough mistakes for you so you can take my reflections on board and begin your own journey to successful bullet journalling.

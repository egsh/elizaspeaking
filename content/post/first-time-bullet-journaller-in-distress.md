Great things can't be rushed, some wise people once said. So here's to my second ever blog post! Hopefully I've started my blog train chugging and it can gain some momentum from here. I've not only neglected my blog, but also my bullet journal of late because I got a bit overwhelmed with uni exams and other stuff going on.

I adore my little notebook because it has become my first 'bullet journal'. I'll do a blog post at some point in the near future about what exactly a bullet journal is and how it could change your life. Anyway, mine is a cute little Paper Blanks notebook that Simon bought for me. I'd like to think that he actually knows me super well enough to have picked it on purpose (and that it wasn't a fluke) because the design is colourful, has flowers AND it's shiny!

I've been bullet journalling for 7 months to the day and, boy, have I made some mistakes! I'm not talking about spelling errors or drawing a line out of place. I'm talking about mistakes with how I physically and practically use my bullet journal. The past 7 months have actually been a labour of love over my journal. Laborious as I tried to create colourful, complex yet practical designs throughout, as you can see below.

But the love was there because I was enjoying the time I put into being creative on something that was purely mine. It all began to fall out of perspective when I was getting behind in the weekly spreads (how can you plan for the future if you haven't a spread to plan it in?!) and the time I was sinking into the layouts was time I'd be taking from other priority tasks (like uni work!)

I pretty much gave it a break through June and just did the bare minimum to keep the year tracking on. I took stock of what I was doing, how it was moving forward, and what I actually wanted to get out of my bullet journal. I realised that my bullet journal had become a labour of love; a bit of a chore; a burden to keep updated. None of these things are what I actually wanted from journal. I've decided that it should be a companion that is functional at keeping my life organised, simple to keep updated and has a hint of creative flare.
